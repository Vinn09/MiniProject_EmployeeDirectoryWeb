# Employee Directory App

This is a **mini project** built to practice frontend development using React, Tailwind CSS, and API integration. The app displays a list of employees fetched from the Reqres API. Each employee card includes detailed information such as:
- Full name (fetched from API)
- Email address (fetched from API)
- Profile picture (fetched from API)
- Contact and address (dummy data)
- Employee details, job information, and achievements (dummy data)

The app is also equipped with **login and register** features using the Reqres API to simulate authentication. Styling is handled using **Tailwind CSS**, and navigation is implemented with **React Router**.

## Features

- Fetch user list dynamically from Reqres API
- Login and Register form using Reqres API endpoints
- View detailed user profiles
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
